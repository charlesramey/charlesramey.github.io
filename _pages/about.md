Hello there! My name is Charles Ramey. I am a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science with an emphasis on Intelligent Systems. My research interests include pattern recognition, low-power embedded systems, capacitive sensing, robotics, and rapid prototyping.

In my free time I enjoy building combat robots, hifi speakers, playing guitar, and cooking.

Here youâ€™ll find a blog page which is host to brief thoughts or short project updates. I also have a dedicated projects page which has information on some of my completed past projects.

If you have any questions please feel free to shoot me an email!
Thanks for reading!
