Inertial electrostatic confinement fusion reactors were first developed by American inventor Philo Farnsworth during the early 1930â€™s. IEC reactors use electrostatic currents to confine deuteron ions to elliptical intersecting paths, causing them to collide and fuse together. Beginning in 2007, I developed a reactor of my own which I successfully produced fusion from.
